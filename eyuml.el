;;; Commentary:

;; Refer to yuml.me site to understand how to represent uml diagram with text

;; You get three functions (each corresponding to a sort of diagram) that you can map to key :

;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c a") 'eyuml-create-activity-diagram)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c c") 'eyuml-create-class-diagram)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c u") 'eyuml-create-usecase-diagram)
